For this homework, I have implemented my bio.html and resume.html, and then linked them to my index.html. I have also linked each html file to my css file, timiresume.html. I also put each of these files and my resources in my public_html directory in my unix account so that it could be connected to my personal website through Tufts CS. I also set up all my permissions as specified by the homework documentation to deal with the 403 error.

As far as collaboration goes, I worked on my project solely without any collaboration, although I did go on W3Schools quite a bit.

I spent about 5-6 hours working on this homework, but I spent the bulk of that time trying to sync sublime with the Tufts Server. I was getting some very weird errors and it took me quite a while to figure it out.
